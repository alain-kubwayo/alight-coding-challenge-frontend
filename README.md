# Google Front Page Design

This is a clone of the Google front page.

## Technologies

* React.js
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS

## Local Setup

To run the project locally, navigate to a folder of your choice on your local machine, then follow the following straightforward steps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alight-Rw/Alight-Codin-Challenge.git coding-challenge
```

This will create a new folder called `coding-challenge`

```bash
cd coding-challenge
```

Then, install the project dependencies with the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

Finally, spin up the local development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see a link in the terminal that looks something like: ```http://localhost:5174/``` Once, clicked it will open a tab in the browser where you will be able to see the project running locally.
